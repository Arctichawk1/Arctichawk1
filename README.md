### Hello, I am Batuhan ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer.

I am using GitHub for collaborating with peers and interacting with the community. For more information about me you can check [batuhanbasoglu.us.to](https://batuhanbasoglu.us.to).

As of 28 August, 2023 I sign all my Git commits with SSH. GitHub will now show these commits as verified, but my SSH key fingerprint is `SHA256:kEsnuHX+qbwhxSAXPUQ4ox535wFHu/hIRaa53FzxRpo` if you'd like to check yourself.
